# Visual-Art-Weka

## An Interactive Web Visualization Tools
This project is based on the Weka data-mining library and D3/Echarts javascript charts, which supports several clustering, classification and association algorithms. We rebuilt the Weka library to make its ouputs suitable for D3 and Echart (see the file, ./WebRoot/WEB-INF/lib/weka.jar).
End-users can use this software to analyze and visualize their data (especially the UCI datasets https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html).

Note that it is built six years ago, and therefore some functions may be deprecated.
